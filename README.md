# ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis of Determinants Influencing Tourist Arrivals and Revenue in Sri Lanka

This project investigates the key factors influencing **tourist arrivals** and **tourism revenue** in Sri Lanka over the last decade, using official data from the **Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA)**.  
We apply probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression modeling in **Python** to uncover insights and provide policy recommendations.
